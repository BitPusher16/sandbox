Coding Challenge (M1)

Our coding challenge is a 3 hour, mostly heads down, module that enables us to  assess your engineering skills across a variety of areas including coding fluency, architecture, concurrency and testing.

You will be coding from scratch based off a prompt we will provide you with on the day of your interview. The prompt will have a set of product requirements that we would like you to pay close attention to and execute upon.

The prompt is as follows: 

You will have 3 hours to build a program from scratch.
Typically, we have either done prompts based on a dispatch problem (where we are dispatching couriers from uber eats/doordash) to pick up orders from our CK facility, or a simulation problem with orders coming off the shelf.

You can use any coding language you feel comfortable with.

Hypothetical prompt: Think of 1,000 kitchens in our facilities. You could be building a system that will parse all orders to be picked up by the correct delivery driver. We will provide structured data around food (Temperature, shelf life, decay, etc.) and you will design the system based on the specific prompt requirements. 

You will be coding locally on your own machine, in whatever developer environment you are most comfortable with. We do not mandate a specific IDE. Similarly, you are able to choose any frameworks, 3rd party libraries, openly available project bootstraps, etc. You can even search syntax on google during this interview. 

Our aim is to simulate working conditions here with questions we face and solve on a daily basis, and see how you execute (mainly) on your own and how you thrive in ambiguity. 

An engineer will log on for the first 15 minutes to help answer any questions you have upon reading the prompt, and give you a guiding hand. Then they will log off and rejoin at the halfway point to answer any more questions that have arisen. They will then log off.

Our grading rubric is as follows:

The submission should have valid runnable code by the end

Code should be production level, with minimal bugs if any

Architecture should be extensible and built to scale for the future

There should be good use of data structures

The submission should be adept at handling concurrency (ie multithreading, multiprocessing)

Tests should be included at the end. We aim for comprehensive unit tests and integration tests, but if one runs short on time (which is quite frequent) even writing an empty test with a single line is better than nothing. You can use the deep dive to verbally expand on your testing philosophy.

Hints:

Things to brush up on (Multi threaded solutions & concurrency) 

Its ambiguous by design, so make sure to document your key decisions you make in your solution somehow some way (a “read me” folder, bullet points, etc.). This will set you up for success on your next module so you already have some topics to bring up with our engineer.


CODING CHALLENGE DEEP DIVE (M1 cont’d)

This is a 1 hour module that serves effectively as a code review once your 3 hours is complete. 

We utilize this time to have you meet with 2 engineers. They might ask about how you approached the assignment, questions about your architectural decisions, modify and run your codes. They will ask you to fix bugs if there’s any of them in real time, or do refactoring. Also they might ask you to implement a new feature in real-time. 

If you didn’t get around to something due to time constraints, like testing, you can verbally explain what you would have done with more time and your testing philosophy.
